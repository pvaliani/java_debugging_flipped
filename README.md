1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?

To stop code execution at a point in time whereby we can check the status or value of a variable against expected output to confirm our program logic

2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?

No it will pause and run the debugger console.


3. How do we debug the next line of code?

We can use step over.


4. What does the step into command do?

Step into will pause at the top of the method. In this case, the deal method rather than “over” the full line of the code. So we can evaluate methods on objects.


5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?

Evaluate expression evaluates a selection of Java code and can call methods on instances of program objects. The evaluate code fragment tool allows us to execute and evaluate multiple lines of code and store information in temporary variables.
